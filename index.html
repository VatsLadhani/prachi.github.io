      <h1>Our Memories</h1>
      <p>
        Everytime I see starbucks do you know what I remember? 
        Our very first date and how we have made it after being thousands of km away.
        recent time have been of both love and anger
        believe it or not I will stand by your side at the end of the day
        Our coming together was something that I never knew could be so beautiful.
        Remember when you used to go for walk and I used to come there saying that I am going to class?
        All those steps taken, all those promises made will be fulfilled to the very end.
        

      </br></br>
        There are thousands of memories in belgaum and mumbai and millions more to come.
